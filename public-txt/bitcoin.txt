First you need to make a Wallet on coin.space

So go to coin.space and it will give a passphrase.

REMEMBER IT, WRITE IT DOWN.



I recommend to go to google keep on your chromebook, it's basically sticky notes


once you have a wallet, you will need a pin so that you can login. remember that too.


Once you made a wallet, click receive. Copy the long number its your wallet address.
